# 100 Citizen
 A simple text-based incremental game I made to learn JavaScript.

It's set in the future in a dystopian city where corruption is everywhere. You decide the fate of your character. Are you going to fight the corruption with good deeds or swim with it? Are you going to stand up against the syndicate politicians?

All for you to decide in 100 Citizen.

This game is entirely a work of fiction.
Any names, organizations, locations, or events appearing in this game are fictitious.
Any resemblance to real names, organizations, locations, events, etc. is purely coincidental.
This game is a work of imagination and fantasy, and above all else, just a game.
